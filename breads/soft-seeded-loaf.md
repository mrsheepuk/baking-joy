# Soft seeded mostly wholemeal loaf

### Ingredients

* 200g white bread flour
* 300g whole bread flour
* 9g (1.5tsp) salt
* 1tsp quick yeast
* 11g chia + 34g water (or an egg)
* 30g olive oil
* 210g oato or whole milk
* 85g water
* 30g sugar

Seed mix:

* 15g pumpkin seeds
* 20g sunflower seeds
* 7g linseeds
* 2g chia
* 2g poppy seeds
* 3g white sesame seeds
* 1g black sesame seeds

### Method

Mix 11g chia and 34g water, leave for ~10 minutes (less for more chia poppiness, more for no 
noticable chia in finished bread) or, if using an egg, beat the egg.

Toast seeds - mix all together and toast in a dry pan for a few minutes, stirring frequently. Let 
cool for a bit.

Combine oil, oato/milk, water and sugar into a bowl and microwave for 90-120s until warm (if warmer
than ~55°, wait for it to cool under that before using so as not to hurt the yeast).

Mix flours, seeds, salt and yeast, make well in middle and add liquid mix then chia egg, mix into a 
ball then turn out, knead for ~10 minutes until smooth/elastic. 

Put in oiled bowl and cover, rise for ~40-60 minutes (test for springing back slowly but not 
completely, approx double in size). 

Punch down then form into loaf, rise 30-40 minutes until finger impression on side remains - 
pre-heat oven to 160° so it's up to temp by the time this is risen.

Bake 33-34 minutes, turning after 20 minutes for even browning unless your oven is amazingly even.

Turn out from tin then knock bottom, should sound hollow. Put on a rack to cool to avoid soggy 
bottom. Wrap in a teatowel to store, keeps well for a good few days but loses some of the lovely
softness after 3-4 days.
