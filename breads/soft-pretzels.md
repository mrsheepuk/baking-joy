# Soft Pretzels

### Ingredients

Dough:

* 100g wholemeal bread flour
* 290g white bread flour plus more in case of too sticky
* 250ml milk
* 29g butter
* 40g sugar
* 1tsp salt
* 1tsp quick yeast

Baking soda bath:

* 1.1 cups warm water
* 1/8 cup baking soda

Toppings:

* 2tbsp melted butter to brush cooked pretzels
* Savoury: sea or rock salt crystals
* Sweet: cinnamon sugar

### Method

Mix 250ml milk, 29g butter, 40g sugar and microwave for ~90s

Mix flours, salt, yeast. Make a well in centre and pour liquid in, mixing until it comes together,
will still be very sticky. Flour surface and turn out and knead for 10 minutes until smooth/elastic,
might need more flour adding to stop it sticking, add 1tsp at a time until it is kneadable.

Once kneaded, put in greased bowl + cover, rise until doubled (~40-60 minutes).

Prepare baking soda bath (mix 1.1 cups warm water + 1/8 cup baking soda in a pyrex bowl / dish big
enough to be able to lower each pretzel into).

Punch down dough, shape into log, cut into 8 pieces and place in covered bowl to keep from drying 
out. 

Pre-heat oven to 190 - 195c. 

Taking pieces one at a time, roll into a rope 24" long and shape into a pretzel shape (make a U then 
cross the tops over, then fold back the tops to the bottom of the U). Lower pretzel into the bath to 
cover, drain well and place on baking sheet.

For savoury, sprinkle the sea/rock salt crystals over before baking.

Bake for 11 minutes until golden.

Brush generously with melted butter. For sweet, dump pretzel after brushing with butter (top and 
bottom) into a bowl full of cinnamon sugar and flip until well covered.
