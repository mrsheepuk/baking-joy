# Standard loaf

Starting recipe for a standard wholemeal-ish loaf. Goes nicely with a nice seed mix.

### Ingredients

* 200g white bread flour
* 300g whole bread flour
* 13.5g (1.5tsp) salt
* 1tsp quick yeast
* 2tbsp olive oil
* 135ml boiling + 165ml cold water

Optional seed mix:

* 15g pumpkin seeds
* 20g sunflower seeds
* 7g linseeds
* 2g chia
* 2g poppy seeds
* 3g white sesame seeds
* 1g black sesame seeds

### Method

> If adding seeds, mix all together and toast in a dry pan for a few minutes, stirring frequently.
> Let cool for a bit then add in with the flour etc.

Mix flours and yeast, add salt and mix, make well in middle and add water & oil, mix into a ball 
then turn out, knead for ~10 minutes until smooth/elastic. 

Put in oiled bowl and cover, rise for ~40-60 minutes (test for springing back slowly but not 
completely, approx double in size). 

Punch down then form into loaf, rise 30-40 minutes until finger impression on side remains - 
pre-heat oven to 210Â° with a dish of boiling water inside so it's up to temp by the time this is 
risen.

Slash top with sharp knife then bake 33-34 minutes.

Turn out from tin then knock bottom, should sound hollow. Put on a rack to cool to avoid soggy 
bottom.
