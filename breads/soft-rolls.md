# Soft Rolls / Soft Loaf

Master recipe for soft rolls - bigger rolls great for burgers, smaller ones great for dinner rolls, 
something in between great for sandwich rolls.

Same dough can also be very successfully used for a loaf.

### Ingredients

* 35g sugar
* 250g whole or s/s or oat milk (Oato, Oatly Barista both tested)
* 45g water
* 45g butter
* 1 egg, beaten (or 11g chia soaked in 34g water for 5-10 minutes)
* 330g white bread flour
* 170g wholemeal bread flour 
* 9g salt 
* 1tsp quick yeast

For richer mix, increase butter to 60g, reduce water by 15g.

### Method 

Beat egg (or soak chia for 5-10 minutes if using instead of egg).

Melt/warm together sugar, milk, water, and butter in microwave (~90-120 seconds) - stir to ensure sugar 
dissolved, check temp <50째, wait to cool below that if too hot.

Mix flours, salt, yeast in a bowl, add 1 beaten egg (or soaked chia) then the liquid, mix until combined 
together.

Once together, turn out onto surface (should be sticky but just about workable without flouring surface), 
knead for ~10 minutes. 

Form into ball, oil bowl & return dough to bowl, cover & rise until doubled. 

**Rolls:** Punch down gently then re-form into ball or log, cut into even-ish pieces (12 for smallish buns, 
8 for burger buns, 16 for dinner rolls) and pinch into balls with a nice clean domed top. Place 
into baking dish with room to rise but also so they crash into each other once risen. Alternatively place 
on a baking tray in a plastic bag and freeze, once frozen remove baking tray and bag tightly.

**Loaf:** Punch down gently then flatten, roll/pinch up into a loaf creating as much tension across the top
as possible. Place in well-greased loaf tin, or freeze tightly wrapped in plastic bag.

Rise until well risen and finger impression remains  (~40 minutes, 5-6 hours from frozen rolls, 7-8 hours
from frozen loaf). Pre-heat oven to 160째 while rising.

**Rolls:** Bake for 22-24 minutes at 160째, turning once for even browning. Once done, brush tops with melted
butter then put into teatowel ASAP to keep lovely and soft.

**Loaf:** Bake for 32-34 minutes at 160째, turning once after ~25 minutes for even browning. Check for being 
done by removing from tin and tapping bottom, should sound hollow.
