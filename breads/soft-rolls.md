# Soft Rolls / Loaf

Master recipe for soft rolls - bigger rolls great for burgers, smaller ones great for dinner rolls, 
something in between great for sandwich rolls.

Same dough can also be very successfully used for a loaf, see bottom.

### Ingredients

* 30g (2tbsp) sugar
* 248g (1 cup) whole milk
* 60g butter
* 1 egg, beaten (or 1tbsp chia soaked in 2.5tbsp water for 5-10 minutes)
* 330g white bread flour (+15g to flour surface)
* 100g wholemeal bread flour 
* 8g (1tsp) salt 
* 1tsp quick yeast

### Method 

Soak chia for 5-10 minutes if using instead of egg.

Melt/warm together sugar, milk and butter in microwave (~90-120 seconds) - stir to ensure sugar 
dissolved, check temp <50째, wait to cool below that if too hot.

Mix flours, salt, yeast in a bowl, add 1 beaten egg (or soaked chia) then the liquid, mix until combined together.

Once together, turn out onto very lightly floured surface, knead for ~10 minutes, will be quite 
sticky. 

Form into ball, oil bowl & return dough to bowl, cover & rise until doubled. 

**Rolls:** Punch down gently then re-form into ball or log, cut into even-ish pieces (12 for smallish buns, 
10 for burger buns, 16 for dinner rolls) and pinch into balls with a nice clean domed top. Place 
into baking dish with room to rise but also so they crash into each other once risen. 

**Loaf:** Punch down gently then flatten, roll/pinch up into a loaf creating as much tension across the top
as possible. Place in well-greased loaf tin.

Rise until well risen and finger impression remains  (~40 minutes). Pre-heat oven to 160째 while 
rising.

**Rolls:** Bake for 22-24 minutes at 160째, turning once for even browning. Once done, brush tops with melted
butter then put into teatowel ASAP to keep lovely and soft.

**Loaf:** Bake for 28-30 minutes at 160째, turning once for even browning. Check for being done by removing
from tin and tapping bottom, should sound hollow.
