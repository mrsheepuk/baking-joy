### Ingredients

Dough:
* 57g melted butter
* 1 egg + 1 egg yolk
* 180ml milk (whole best)
* 2 tsp quick yeast
* 400g white bread flour
* 1/4 cup sugar
* 0.75 tsp salt

Cinnamon sugar layer:
* 57g softened butter
* 2/3 cup sugar
* 1.5 tbsp cinnamon


### Method

Melt 57g butter, beat 1 egg+1 yolk, microwave 180ml milk for 60s, mix all in glass bowl and sprinkle 
2tsp yeast over, mix well. Mix 400g flour+3/4tsp salt+1/4cup sugar in medium sized mixing bowl 
then add liquid mixture. Mix until combined then turn out, knead until it comes together - may need 
to add a little more flour during kneading as this is a very sticky dough.

Form into ball, clean+grease bowl then return dough to it. Cover and rise for ~40-60 minutes until 
doubled.

While rising, soften the other 57g butter, mix 2/3cup sugar+1.5tbsp cinnamon in a bowl. Grease 
a square Pyrex and 2x ramekins.

Once risen, punch down and knead a bit then roll out in a portrait direction to approx 14"x9", 
trying to keep it a consistent thin layer (thin is good - moarrr sprialz!). Thinner better than 
right sized, but being a good rectangular shape helps a lot.

Spread softened butter all over the dough except for a 1/4" gap at the far edge, then sprinkle the 
cinnamon sugar mixture evenly all over. Rub sugar into butter.

Roll as tightly as possible, starting from the narrow side closest to you. Using sharp serrated 
knife, chop ~1"' off each end (runts with sub optional filling - put in the ramekins) then chop into 
9 even sized pieces. Arrange slices in a 3x3 array in square pyrex. 

Second rise covered for ~30 minutes until doubled - ideally stop before they start to disassemble 
themselves. While rising, preheat oven to 160Â°, then once risen bake 20-22 minutes until golden 
brown on top.

Cool and serve. Get fat.
